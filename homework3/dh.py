import expo

# Write client server programs using TCP sockets
# where the client (Alice) and the server (Bob) perform a Diffie Hellman exchange.
# Use the expo porgram to compute the Diffie Hellman numbers. 
# Let g = 1907, p = 784313
# S_A = 160031, S_B = 12077

# Output must show the numbers sent by Alice and Bob for DH exchange
# as well as the shared key after the exchange.
